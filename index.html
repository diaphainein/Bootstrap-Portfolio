                    Howdy! I'm Lauren. I love to code! After a whirlwind love affair with Java in college, I've been all about learning and devouring new languages. I'm a graduate of The Coding Bootcamp at UCSD, where I've learned all kinds of exciting technologies. Some of the things I've learned include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Handlebars.js, React.js, Node.js (my favorite!), Express.js, MySQL, MongoDB, ReactNative, and lots more! As far as non-coding interests, I'm a huge music fan (I love new wave, dark wave, post punk, industrial and goth, metal, and assorted indie (such as old school emo, chillwave, folk, etc)), and in a past life (as in, when I was in my 20s) I was a hairdresser and makeup artist. I still love those things, but only when I get to do what I want with them. After a decade of doing the things others want me to do, I've decided that any hair and/or makeup I do in the future will be on my terms, with my concepts. I enjoy things that are slightly off the beaten path -- I have green hair, and I get super starstruck around drag queens. I'm a HUGE fan of RuPaul's Drag Race. I'm also a burlesque perfomer, and a drag performer. Yep! I do male drag. It's a lot of fun, and it allows my inner theatre geek to come out and play. I also enjoy gaming, reading (mostly fantasy and sci-fi), Netflix binging, snorkeling and diving, and hanging out with my kitties and giant bunnies.
